In particular, incidence rates of hospitalization with atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke have shown to exhibit a seasonal variation. Stroke in AF patients is common and often severe. Obtaining a description of a possible seasonal variation in the occurrence of stroke in AF patients is crucial in clarifying risk factors for developing stroke and initiating prophylaxis treatment.",

title="Data Fusion Techniques for Improving Soil Moisture Deficit Using SMOS Satellite and WRF-NOAH Land Surface Model",
journal="Water Resources Management",
year="2013",
volume="27",
number="15",
pages="5069--5087",
abstract="Microwave remote sensing and mesoscale weather models have high potential to monitor global hydrological processes. The latest satellite soil moisture dedicated mission SMOS and WRF-NOAH Land Surface Model (WRF-NOAH LSM) provide a flow of coarse resolution soil moisture data, which may be useful data sources for hydrological applications. In this study, four data fusion techniques: Linear Weighted Algorithm (LWA), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Kalman Filter (KF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are evaluated for Soil Moisture Deficit (SMD) estimation using the SMOS and WRF-NOAH LSM derived soil moisture. The first method (and most simplest) utilizes a series of simple combinations between SMOS and WRF-NOAH LSM soil moisture products, while the second uses a predictor equation generally formed by dependent variables (Probability Distributed Model based SMD) and independent predictors (SMOS and WRF-NOAH LSM). The third and fourth techniques are based on rigorous calibration and validation and need proper optimisation for the final outputs backboned by strong non-linear statistical analysis. The performances of all the techniques are validated against the probability distributed model based soil moisture deficit as benchmark; estimated using the ground based observed datasets. The observed high Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies between the fused datasets with Probability Distribution Model clearly demonstrate an improved performance from the individual products. However, the overall analysis indicates a higher capability of ANN and KF for data fusion than the LWA or MLR approach. These techniques serve as one of the first demonstrations that there is hydrological relevant information in the coarse resolution SMOS satellite and WRF-NOAH LSM data, which could be used for hydrological applications.",

abstract="The estimation of commodity spot price models often involves the estimation of risk premiums. We show in a simulation study that the market prices of risk cannot be accurately estimated using two popular estimation techniques; the Kalman filter and an iterative routine. Risk premium parameters may be dependent on the starting value for the iterative routine, and cannot be accurately estimated using the Kalman filter technique. We conclude with a short analysis of results from the spot price model literature by examining the implied volatility term structure from other published research papers.",
